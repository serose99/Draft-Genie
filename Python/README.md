# Draft Genie

## What it is
Draft Genie is an integrated machine learning model that uses the past 10 years of NBA statistics to predict where a player currently entering the draft will be drafted.

## How it works
By creating a DecisionTreeRegressor model and training it on past NBA draft stats, the model is able to accurately predict where a new player will be drafted.

## How I made it
1. Took introductory tutorial courses from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)
2. Gathered data from previous NBA Drafts from various online sources
3. Created and tested model for performance

## What I learned
I started by teaching myself python which was very beneficial to use for this project. The combination of pandas and sklearn models helped build this draft predictor from the ground up. I hope to further expand my knowledge in the field of machine learning/data science and am pursuing a career in the field.
